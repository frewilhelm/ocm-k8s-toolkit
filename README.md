OCM K8s Toolkit contains the tooling for
- providing the location of OCM resources from an OCM component version, so it can be consumed by a deployer. It is used
    to deploy OCM resources like a HelmChart or Kustomization into a Kubernetes cluster.
- providing a controller to transfer OCM component versions.
